We cannot run the side-effects and async tasks in the reducers.
So we can run them in 
1. components using useEffect()
2. Inside the action creators



Where should out logic go -> reducers / components / action
1. synchronous, side-effects free code --- Prefer reducers
2. async code or code with side-effects --- Prefer action creators or components
