We cannot run the side-effects and async tasks in the reducers.
So we can run them in 
1. components using useEffect()
2. Inside the action creators



Where should out logic go -> reducers / components / action
1. synchronous, side-effects free code --- Prefer reducers
2. async code or code with side-effects --- Prefer action creators or components



Until now we have created the async code in the App component. Now lets create it in the action creator.

We will be introduced to a new terminology called THUNK.
THUNK - A function that delays an action Until later.

If redux sees that a dispatch is actually return an actions which is actually a function, then Redux will execture that function
and its actions will be dispatched
